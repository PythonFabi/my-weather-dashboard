# My Weather Dashboard

## Description

Welcome to the weather dashboard app. Here, you can see the current weather conditions and the weather for the next five days for any city.
This project is here for anybody, who wants to quickly see the weather, to plan their day accordingly.
It is easy to use and it helped me understand on how to integrate server-side apis in a dynamic webpage with html, css and javascript.

Here is a link to the deployed weather app: [weather dashboard](https://pythonfabi.github.io/my-weather-dashboard/)

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Once you open the app, you are presented with a search city field, which allows you to enter any city you want.

After you entered the city, press the search button and you will be presented

![city-search ](https://github.com/PythonFabi/my-weather-dashboard/assets/129299589/90a67c40-6e8b-4af2-8fbf-17dc4200f809)

with the current weather and forecast for the next five days.

the specific data is the city name, the date, the current or future temperature, windspeed and humidity as well as an icon that shows you the weather description.

Additionally, you will see under the search button the search history of the recent citys you searched for, which you can click to see the weather for the specific city.

This saves you time, to not enter the same city over and over again.

Enjoy!
